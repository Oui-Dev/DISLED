 * RGB LED PWM on TIM3 (channels 1 to 3, active high, edge aligned).
 *
 * Duties are given in sub-ticks (1/16 of a tick, see pwm_dither.h): the
 * update interrupt of every period dithers them into whole ticks. The
 * period is kept within PWM_DITHER_PERIOD_MAX so that 100 % fits 16 bits.
 *
 * The driver also offers a "sample point": TIM3 channel 4 compare, used as
 * an internal event only (its output, which would land on the touch pin
 * PB1, is never enabled). The touch driver arms it to measure at a fixed
 * phase of the PWM period, away from the LED switching edges (constraint N1
 * in hardware/README.md).
