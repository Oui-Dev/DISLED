# Licensing

DISLED is free software and open hardware.

| Part | Path | License |
|---|---|---|
| Firmware, desktop app, protocol, scripts and documentation | everything outside `hardware/` | GPL-3.0-or-later with the additional permission below ([LICENSE](LICENSE)) |
| Hardware design files | `hardware/` | CERN-OHL-S-2.0 ([hardware/LICENSE](hardware/LICENSE)) |

Third-party code keeps its own license:

- **TinyUSB** (`firmware/lib/tinyusb`, git submodule): MIT.
- **WCH CH32V20x SDK**: Nanjing Qinheng Microelectronics terms. PlatformIO downloads it at build time and this repository does not contain it. The additional permission below covers linking with it.
- **wchisp** (the flasher of the lamp updates, in the desktop app installers): GPL-2.0. A separate program that the app runs, never linked with it. Its license and notice are in `app/src-tauri/third-party/wchisp`, and its source is attached to every app release ([ADR 0016](docs/decisions/0016-lamp-updates.md)).
- **Montserrat** (the font of the desktop app, bundled from the `@fontsource-variable/montserrat` package): SIL Open Font License 1.1, The Montserrat Project Authors.
- **Lucide** (the icons of the desktop app, bundled from the `@iconify-json/lucide` package): ISC, Lucide Contributors.

### Additional permission under GNU GPL version 3 section 7

If you modify this Program, or any covered work, by linking or combining
it with the WCH CH32V20x software development kit (the startup code,
system and peripheral libraries and device headers published by Nanjing
Qinheng Microelectronics Co., Ltd.) (or a modified version of that
library), containing parts covered by the terms of the Nanjing Qinheng
Microelectronics software license, the licensors of this Program grant
you additional permission to convey the resulting work.

This text follows the template from the Free Software Foundation GPL FAQ
("What legal issues come up if I use GPL-incompatible libraries with GPL
software?"). The optional sentence that requires shipping the library
source is left out, because the redistribution terms of the WCH SDK are
not clear.

Every source file points to this permission with a header like:

```
SPDX-License-Identifier: GPL-3.0-or-later
SPDX-FileCopyrightText: 2026 The DISLED contributors
Additional permission under GNU GPL version 3 section 7: see LICENSING.md.
```

## Contributions

Contributions are accepted under the same terms, including the additional
permission above.

## USB identifiers

During development the firmware uses VID:PID `1209:0001`, the
[pid.codes test PID](https://pid.codes/1209/0001/). It is reserved for
private testing and must not ship on devices that are redistributed, sold
or manufactured. A dedicated PID will be requested from pid.codes before
the first batch is built.
