# DISLED desktop app

The desktop app is a Tauri 2 app that lives in the tray, with a popup to
control the lamp and a Diagnostics window. The
[user guide](../docs/user-guide.md) describes what it does for its users,
and [docs/architecture.md](../docs/architecture.md#desktop-app) how it
works. This page is for working on it.

## Run it

You need Node.js 24 or later and the Rust toolchain (`rustup`), plus the
Visual Studio Build Tools with the C++ workload on Windows, or the Xcode
command line tools on macOS.

```sh
npm install
npm run tauri dev
```

The app finds the lamp by itself, by its USB IDs `1209:0001` and
`1209:0002`, and reconnects when you plug it back in. It needs no driver.
`tauri dev` never checks for updates by itself, and never turns on start at
login, which would register the debug executable.

To try a lamp update from `tauri dev`, install wchisp on the PATH
(`cargo install wchisp@0.3.0 --locked`). The app offers only published
firmware signed with the update key, but a debug build also takes a local
file, unsigned. Start it with `DISLED_FIRMWARE_HEX` set to the path of a
`disled-fw-X.Y.Z.hex`, whose name gives the version, then use **Check for
updates** in the settings. Release builds ignore that variable.

## The udev rule on Linux

By default, only root may open a USB HID device on Linux. The `.deb`
installs a udev rule, `/usr/lib/udev/rules.d/70-disled.rules`
([source](src-tauri/linux/70-disled.rules)), that gives the logged-in user
access to the lamp and to the WCH bootloader, for `wchisp`. To run the app
from source, install the rule once by hand:

```sh
sudo cp src-tauri/linux/70-disled.rules /etc/udev/rules.d/
sudo udevadm control --reload-rules && sudo udevadm trigger
```

## Front end

The front end is Vue 3 with [Nuxt UI](https://ui.nuxt.com) 4 through its
Vite plugin, without Nuxt, and uses its components wherever one fits,
charts included. The plugin imports the components by itself and writes
`src/components.d.ts`. A component name starts with its folder:
`lamp/LampColorPicker.vue` is `<LampColorPicker>`. Functions are imported
explicitly, through the `@/` alias of `src/`. Vite finds the Nuxt UI
components in use when it starts, and only those get their styles, so
restart `npm run tauri dev` after using one for the first time.

- **State.** One Pinia store per domain lives in `src/stores`, and each
  window starts the ones it shows (`src/App.vue`). The stores talk to the
  backend through `src/ipc`: typed wrappers of the Tauri commands and a
  typed map of the events.
- **Types from Rust.** ts-rs writes the types exchanged with the backend to
  `src/bindings` when the Rust tests run. After a change to one of those
  Rust types, run `npm run bindings`. The checks fail when the committed
  files are out of date ([CONTRIBUTING.md](../CONTRIBUTING.md#checks)).
- **Accessibility.** The windows aim at WCAG 2.2 AA, except for the
  contrast of the primary color (below).

### Design system

`src/assets/css/main.css` brings Tailwind, Nuxt UI, the self-hosted
Montserrat font and the token overrides. `src/assets/css/palettes.css`
holds the two palettes. `ink`, the neutral one, goes from the brand white
`#fefcf7`, the light background, to the brand black `#050a06`, the dark
one. `brand`, the primary one, is built on the logo green `#2ecc71`.
Nothing checks the contrasts, so a change there must keep neutral text at
4.5:1 and the primary at about 3.8:1.

### Translations

The messages live in `src/locales/en.json` and `src/locales/fr.json`. The
windows read them with [vue-i18n](https://vue-i18n.intlify.dev), compiled
at build time. The backend reads the `tray` and `window` sections for the
tray menu and the window titles (`src-tauri/src/i18n.rs`), so these must
stay plain text. English is the reference: TypeScript rejects a French file
that lacks a message, and `cargo test` checks that both files have the same
keys. Errors from the libraries of the backend stay in English, inside a
translated sentence.

To add a language:

- **Messages.** `src/locales/<code>.json`, with every message of `en.json`.
- **Rust.** A variant of `Language` (`src-tauri/src/settings.rs`) and of
  `Locale` (`src-tauri/src/i18n.rs`). In `i18n.rs`, its file in `MESSAGES`,
  in the order of `Locale`, its arm in `Locale::of`, its system tag in
  `from_tag` and its keys in the test that compares the files. Then
  `npm run bindings`.
- **Windows.** In `src/i18n.ts`, its messages, number and date formats,
  plural rule when the default of vue-i18n does not fit, and Nuxt UI words
  (`nuxtUiLocales`). In `src/components/popup/PopupSettings.vue`, its entry
  in the language choices, named in that language.

The Rust code is one Cargo workspace at the repository root, with this app
(`src-tauri`), the shared crates (`../crates`) and the production tool
(`../tools`). Its build output goes to `../target`.

## Logo

The logo is the lamp in isometric view, at the enclosure's dimensions, lit
green. `app-icon.png` is the source of the app icons. After a change,
regenerate them:

```sh
npx tauri icon
rm -r src-tauri/icons/android src-tauri/icons/ios src-tauri/icons/64x64.png
```

The tray icon is not an image. `src-tauri/src/tray.rs` draws it at run time
in the color of the lamp.

## Checks
